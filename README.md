A curious spirit with a passion for magic, both in code and movies. I journey through realms of programming languages, always eager to learn, create, and challenge the norms.

- 🎮 **PC Games** — All about RPG's and builders; everything that challenges the mind.
- 💡 **Problem Solving** — Improving my coding skills daily, refactoring my thoughts, learning new tricks.
